This contains the Aptos back-end functions used to aggregate and fetch NFT data.


## Branching

Below is the recommended environment:

- master

  > Production Branch. This is used to hold the latest stable version that is live in production.

- develop

  > Development Branch. Branched out from master. New feature branches are created from develop. When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch. It serves as our aggregated branch for all finished features
